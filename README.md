These are most likely him, that's most likely his IP address. Click on `diff` to see the changes.

* [May 6, 2017 & May 14, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.103.141.68) so this is probably around the time, when y'all contacted him about me.

    * from the article ""Commercial AI packages don't make the source code available, and you have no idea what's going on in there," said Moore. "That's one of the benefits of an open source AI package: everyone can see what it's doing." "you have no idea what's going on in there" yeah no ... that's not true. it's sometimes true, but generally not true
    * "Moore hopes to also implement a Clippy-like virtual assistant to guide users." i wonder wtf this was supposed to be and who was supposed to work on it lol

* [May 26, 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170629030425/http://www.epistasisblog.org/2017/05/) big ugly was big mad about something around this time: `Francis Collins and the NIH want to take grants away from me` extreme paranoia and just bizarre, what an absolute gorilla, [sounds like this in my head as i read it](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/these-must-have-been-important-days-for-grifting/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-19%20at%202.18.21%20PM.png)

   * [August 29, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=797753654&diffmode=source) ohhh ooppsss 2017 not 2018, this could be related to other interviews i had in 2017 that may have reached out to him around this time.
   * [December 17, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marylyn_D._Ritchie&diff=prev&oldid=815774553&diffmode=source): I know why and to what this was changed around this time, but I won't say it here.

* [July, 29 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.103.149.238) hmm this date is a mystery to me, not sure what triggered it, could be something from your end, something did trigger this though. @ 9:03 am, first thing in the morning too lol. July 18, 2018, I responded to when James Taylor (RIP) @ JHU asked me for my references and I emailed him back with Jason's email along with a few other people (7 references in total). Perhaps, that could have triggered this.
* [February 23, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/72.94.81.68) so this likely has to do with the Weill Cornell Phd Program, probably reaching out to him etc. they must have sent him my personal statement around this time and etc. and he lost his mind bc he thought i was trying to copy his mediocre work when i could care less or whatever psychotic episode he was going through at the time.
   * [his edits including his link to his twitter were removed LOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=884747414&diffmode=source)

USA Today was triggered [by this that came out Apr 11, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/scott-kelly-twins-study-nasa.html) USA Today is not quite the New York Times :joy: oofffff i just read it, it hasn't aged too well esp now with LLMs in medicine. he's basically saying "if i can't do it, no one can" he's not giving any examples of successes of AI in Medicine and even for the time, 2019, there were a lot. i want my 2 mins back that took the time read that article, drivel, waste of time. [compare and contrast with newspaper articles on AI in Medicine by Lutz Finger for example, just one example](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lutzfinger/?sh=6c7383256ec2) night and day, faking it vs knowing what youre taking about

* [July, 2 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.172.227) `</ref> In 2021 he was elected a Member of the International Statistics Institute (ISI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isi-web.org/about-isi/who-is-isi/members/indivual|title=Elected Members of the International Statistics Institute (ISI)}}</ref>` [it says on their wikipedia page that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Institute) "The affiliated Associations have membership open to any professional statistician" so it's really not that difficult to get in, he applied bc his background was stats and he was accepted quite easily. not a big deal.
* [December 18, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.165.45) he made himself a data scientist here, again, with no formal training whatsoever. anyone can wikipedia, even jason moore.

Aside: He's updating [his own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history) because no one else will :joy: yeah i looked up other Professors he may be stalking ... they're not updating their own Wikipedia pages, it's getting updated by other well known Wikipedia users with actual accounts. lol sad.

This dude has no friends, failed personal relationships (including his own marriage), total freakshow **incel**. complete and absolute, walking and talking, unmedicated and **untreated mental illness**.

[A System for Accessible Artificial Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90512-9_8) this is not in a top journal and it has barely any citations but ... but its supposed to be apparently the biggest breakthrough in AI so much so it elicited frivolous IP claims. Nobody cares about this, i don't care about this work.

4/14 - im actually really busy all day today so i will come back to this over the weekend .. this is important lawyer work .. he's legitimizing himself via wikipedia and twitter, by himself, not via other people. it's all himself, self-promotion to stay afloat in a competitive field, so pathetic. This **proves** that he's been spying/stalking people at wcmc and me since 2017 and he has an extreme inferiority complex and gets personally triggered by other peoples happiness and success -- that he just cant achieve for himself, ever.

4/20 - i discovered another website that big ugly jason has been depositing information into, a lot after more after 2017 than previous years. there's information depositing on Feb 23 and April 23 over the years. So this has been a seriously deep obsession for him, **like this is one of the worst stalker types ever possible.** there are other things i found that i wont say here, but he's CLEARLY very very mentally ill, it doesnt seem like hes been getting any help at all

# How Jason Moore attempts to legitimize himself in academia: the long con
*	Publish papers to the Journal he is EIC of (BioData Mining with an impact factor = 4.079 (as of 2021))
*	Frequently update his own Wikipedia page and then also the Wikipedia page of Marylyn Ritchie (did she ask him to do this, I don’t get it?)
*	Recruit former students as Post-docs/Faculty (because no one else will hire them) because he selects or attracts people with low self-esteem that cannot think except for what he tells them to, so they can’t really make it out on their own after being his student. They cannot survive without his connections and ideas (e.g. epistasis), which aren’t that great either.
*	Follow random people on Twitter to bring up his follower count
*	Tweet articles that he likely doesn’t completely read and use the hashtags #bioinformatics #artificialintelligence #machinelearning -- all areas he has no training in from Grad school (i.e. he never studied under a Professor who has training in this area. He has never published in top journals/conferences in AI/ML.)
*	Cite his own papers
*	Publish these “10 top lists” type of papers that only reference his work in the citations (so veiled self-promotion) and they don’t get much citations, if any. They’re just there, they just exist to bloat a CV. They otherwise could have been blog posts.
*	Have his former/current students, people in his cult, cite his papers, their own papers etc.
*	Publish work in AI that gets 0 citations, in other words, it’s not interesting, no one reads it, no one cites it. It’s just there, it just exists to bloat his CV. Or lick cookies, so he can say “hey I came up with it first” etc.
*	Pursue frivolous intellectual property lawsuits/whatever
*	Stalk/spy on former (a) employee(s)
*	Stalk/spy on potential employers of former employees
*	Stalk/spy on the private lives of potential employers of former employees
*	Defame/slander via racism and misogyny people to make himself seem more legit and knowing of things even though he's a half-wit
*	Name his software after the school: e.g. "PennAI" to use the name of the school to legitimize and bring attention to his otherwise average work with barely any citations
*	Build meeting rooms that no one really needs like the Idea Factory
*	Hire the “Paul Wang” type to run a Bioinformatics Core, someone completely underqualified who does not publish which is bizarre for Directors of Bioinformatics Cores – but Jason has no training in bioinformatics ... except what he picked up on Wikipedia ... how would he know the difference when someone is qualified or isn’t.
* Buy domain names for projects when it's really supposed to be hosted on *.penn.edu
* [claiming as an author to a article to extremetech.com that he has formal training in AI when he never did or that he knows what data science is](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319005-the-day-i-learned-what-data-science-is)
   * "My own academic training is grounded in a specific biological application domain but with __formal training in artificial intelligence (AI),__ complex adaptive systems, and statistics. I didn't know it at the time, but my cross-disciplinary training prepared me very well for a career in data science."

What is it called when you can't stop laughing but you also want to vomit at the same time from all the cringe and disgust lol, that's how I feel. [AHHH look it's Dunning-Freddy-Kruger :joy:](https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Jason.Moore/photo)

# Jason Moore's Education/Training Discrepancies and Claims
* [January 11, 2021 claiming as an author to a article to extremetech.com that he has formal training in AI when he never did or that he knows what data science is](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319005-the-day-i-learned-what-data-science-is)
   * "My own academic training is grounded in a specific biological application domain but with __formal training in artificial intelligence (AI),__ complex adaptive systems, and statistics. I didn't know it at the time, but my cross-disciplinary training prepared me very well for a career in data science."
   * the article reads as something written by an enthusiast and hobbyist, really, it truely does, because he does not have the training in the area, he did not do the work, but he's telling people how the field is suppose to work
   * very bizarre and weird, there are no citations to his claims in the article from sources in data science, it's just his personal experience and (lack of) understanding that he keeps mentioning
* according to [this (persoanl webpage):](https://jasonhmoore.org/education/) 
   * "I also took several courses in the Center for the Study of Complex Systems." so he never took classes in Computer Science or AI or Computational Biology, never recieved a degree in Complex Systems, Computer Science/AI
* [lying about his Masters degree, also this is quite hilarious](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/Hey_Jason_Moore____ThisIsJustTheBeginningOfYourSelf-InflictedDownfall_DontBlameMeOrOthersEver/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-19%20at%207.48.00%20AM.png) so if he can lie about his degree, he can lie about anything really

This is all going to look very bad in front of a judge
