These are most likely him, that's most likely his IP address. Click on `diff` to see the changes.

* [May 6, 2017 & May 14, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.103.141.68) so this is probably around the time, when y'all contacted him about me.

    * from the article ""Commercial AI packages don't make the source code available, and you have no idea what's going on in there," said Moore. "That's one of the benefits of an open source AI package: everyone can see what it's doing." "you have no idea what's going on in there" yeah no ... that's not true. it's sometimes true, but generally not true
    * "Moore hopes to also implement a Clippy-like virtual assistant to guide users." i wonder wtf this was supposed to be and who was supposed to work on it lol

   * [August 29, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=797753654&diffmode=source) ohhh ooppsss 2017 not 2018, this could be related to other interviews i had in 2017 that may have reached out to him around this time.
   * [December 17, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marylyn_D._Ritchie&diff=prev&oldid=815774553&diffmode=source): I know why and to what this was changed around this time, but I won't say it here.

   * [his edits including his link to his twitter were removed LOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=884747414&diffmode=source)
* [July, 2 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.172.227)
* [December 18, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.165.45) he made himself a data scientist here, again, with no formal training whatsoever. anyone can wikipedia, even jason moore.

Aside: He's updating [his own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history) because no one else will :joy: yeah i looked up other Professors he may be stalking ... they're not updating their own Wikipedia pages, it's getting updated by other well known Wikipedia users with actual accounts. lol sad.

This dude has no friends, failed personal relationships (including his own marriage), total freakshow **incel**. complete and absolute, walking and talking, unmedicated and **untreated mental illness**.

[A System for Accessible Artificial Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90512-9_8) this is not in a top journal and it has barely any citations but ... but its supposed to be apparently the biggest breakthrough in AI so much so it elicited frivolous IP claims. Nobody cares about this, i don't care about this work.

4/14 - im actually really busy all day today so i will come back to this over the weekend .. this is important lawyer work .. he's legitimizing himself via wikipedia and twitter, by himself, not via other people. it's all himself, self-promotion to stay afloat in a competitive field, so pathetic. This **proves** that he's been spying/stalking people at wcmc and me since 2017 and he has an extreme inferiority complex and gets personally triggered by other peoples happiness and success -- that he just cant achieve for himself, ever.

# How Jason Moore attempts to legitimize himself in academia: the long con
* Publish papers to the Journal he is EIC of
* Update his own Wikipedia page/pages :joy:
* Recruit former students as Faculty (bc no one else will hire them)
* Follow random people on Twitter to bring up his follower count
* Tweet articles that he likely doesnt completely read and use the hashtags #bioinformatics #artificialintelligence #machinelearning -- all areas he has no training in from Grad school (i.e. he never studied under a Professor who has training in this area)
* Cite his own papers
* Have his former/current students, people in his cult, cite his papers, their own papers etc.
* Publish work in AI that gets 0 citations, in other words, its not interesting, no one reads it, no one cites it
* Pursue frivolous intellectual property lawsuits/whatever
* Stalk former employees
* Stalk potential employers of former employees
* Stalk perhaps the private lives of potential employers of former employees
* Defame/slander people to make himself seem more legit and knowing of things even though he's a half-wit
* Name your software after the school: e.g. "PennAI" to use the name of the school to legitimize and bring attention to your otherwise average work with barely any citations

What is it called when you can't stop laughing but you also want to vomit at the same time from all the cringe and disgust lol, that's how I feel. [AHHH look it's Dunning-Freddy-Kruger :joy:](https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Jason.Moore/photo)
