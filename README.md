# 2017
* February 23, 2017, I resigned in Donna's office
* April 23, 2017, last day of being on Penn's payroll
* ~ May, 2017, [stalking with motive was initiated by Jason and etc. bc i had other interviews.](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/types_of_stalkers/blob/main/Screenshot%202023-05-08%20at%207.40.58%20AM.png) it could be sooner, i don't know what was happening at penn from feb 23-may 2017, i didnt care about them but i do know jason was following me on twitter during this time and i did post pictures of new york and etc. on twitter (account was deleted, but i remember i did).
* [May 6, 2017 & May 14, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.103.141.68) so this is probably around the time, when y'all contacted him about me.
    * [14:44, 6 May 2017 diff hist](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=779017139&diffmode=source): `current work also focuses on methods and software for accessible artificial intelligence<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Randal S.|last2=Sipper|first2=Moshe|last3=La Cava|first3=William|last4=Tartarone|first4=Sharon|last5=Vitale|first5=Steven|last6=Fu|first6=Weixuan|last7=Holmes|first7=John H.|last8=Moore|first8=Jason H.|date=2017-05-01|title=A System for Accessible Artificial Intelligence|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00594|journal=arXiv:1705.00594 [cs]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/researchers-want-people-to-seize-the-means-of-ai-production-penn-ai|title=These Researchers Want the People to Seize the Means of AI Production|website=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref>.`
    * from the article ""Commercial AI packages don't make the source code available, and you have no idea what's going on in there," said Moore. "That's one of the benefits of an open source AI package: everyone can see what it's doing." "you have no idea what's going on in there" yeah no ... that's not true. it's sometimes true, but generally not true
    * "Moore hopes to also implement a Clippy-like virtual assistant to guide users." i wonder wtf this was supposed to be and who was supposed to work on it lol

* [May 26, 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170629030425/http://www.epistasisblog.org/2017/05/) big ugly was big mad about something around this time: `Francis Collins and the NIH want to take grants away from me` extreme paranoia and just bizarre, what an absolute gorilla, [sounds like this in my head as i read it](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/these-must-have-been-important-days-for-grifting/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-19%20at%202.18.21%20PM.png)
* [August 16, 2017](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/these-must-have-been-important-days-for-grifting/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-27%20at%202.45.12%20PM.png) - Traffic Violation, Exceed 25 Mph Residence Dist. By 18 Mph in Delaware, Delaware, PA.
   * this is pretty weird actually. hes like in 50s and hes driving 18 miles above the speed limit at a residental area (in mainline which is like nice and quiet), that's pretty weird, ive never done that before, speeding on the turnpike is something else, everyone does it, cops are more likeley to stop you esp in south jersey, but speeding in a residental area is weird, you should be too old for that kind of stuff, the tickets ive gotten (2 only) were bc i was in my 20s, ive since grown up, same with my brother, no recent issues
   * **hes too old for a lot shit he keeps doing like hes very immature for his age its very very weird** like nobody has ever given him feedback in life bc hes not around people who can and can challenge him, so he never actually developed properly which is why he has so many issues now, and with the law which is forthcoming
   * hes a lunatic, absolutely
   * but we know what he was thinking about at the time and what added to the reasons that led him to be so very likely angry and reckless while driving, weird, super weird, 
   * batshit crazy, cannot emphasize this enough
   * 2fast2furious2batshitcrazy
   * oh so he had to go to court, which means he got a lawyer and went in front of a judge to plead guilty for speeding LOL as a 50 years old man, thats so weird. whackjob, completely, complete lunatic. w-e-i-r-d
* [August 29, 2017 & Sep 1, 2017 & December 17, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/173.49.21.194)
   * [August 29, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=797753654&diffmode=source) ohhh ooppsss 2017 not 2018, this could be related to other interviews i had in 2017 that may have reached out to him around this time.
   * [December 17, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marylyn_D._Ritchie&diff=prev&oldid=815774553&diffmode=source): I know why and to what this was changed around this time, but I won't say it here.

# 2018
* [January 6, 2018](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/Hey_Jason_Moore____ThisIsJustTheBeginningOfYourSelf-InflictedDownfall_DontBlameMeOrOthersEver/blob/main/Screenshot%202023-05-06%20at%202.58.23%20PM.png) i reached out to jason to write a LoR to Rutgers Quantitative Biology's PhD Program with two other LoRs. He played dumb and wanted to know if i was qualified to just apply, even though he already had my CV and was forwarding it around at Penn.
* [July, 29 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/74.103.149.238) hmm this date is a mystery to me, not sure what triggered it, could be something from your end, something did trigger this though. @ 9:03 am, first thing in the morning too lol. July 18, 2018, I responded to when James Taylor (RIP) @ JHU asked me for my references and I emailed him back with Jason's email along with a few other people (7 references in total). Perhaps, that could have triggered this.
* [February 23, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/72.94.81.68) so this likely has to do with the Weill Cornell Phd Program, probably reaching out to him etc. they must have sent him my personal statement around this time and etc. and he lost his mind bc he thought i was trying to copy his mediocre work when i could care less or whatever psychotic episode he was going through at the time.
   * [his edits including his link to his twitter were removed LOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&diff=prev&oldid=884747414&diffmode=source)

# 2019

USA Today was triggered [by this that came out Apr 11, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/scott-kelly-twins-study-nasa.html) USA Today is not quite the New York Times :joy: oofffff i just read it, it hasn't aged too well esp now with LLMs in medicine. he's basically saying "if i can't do it, no one can" he's not giving any examples of successes of AI in Medicine and even for the time, 2019, there were a lot. i want my 2 mins back that took the time read that article, drivel, waste of time. [compare and contrast with newspaper articles on AI in Medicine by Lutz Finger for example, just one example](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lutzfinger/?sh=6c7383256ec2) night and day, faking it vs knowing what youre taking about

# 2020
* [April 23, 2020](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/these-must-have-been-important-days-for-grifting/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-14%20at%205.59.20%20PM.png) `#artificialintelligence #datascience #healthcare`

* November, 2020 - I realized emails were being forwarded to Jason/Penn. It was too late to ask someone else to write a letter of rec to the BME program.

# 2021
* [July, 2 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.172.227) `</ref> In 2021 he was elected a Member of the International Statistics Institute (ISI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isi-web.org/about-isi/who-is-isi/members/indivual|title=Elected Members of the International Statistics Institute (ISI)}}</ref>` [it says on their wikipedia page that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Institute) "The affiliated Associations have membership open to any professional statistician" so it's really not that difficult to get in, he applied bc his background was stats and he was accepted quite easily. not a big deal.
* [December 18, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.52.165.45) he made himself a data scientist here, again, with no formal training whatsoever. anyone can wikipedia, even jason moore. who would update their own wikipedia page ... on their birthday, wow, sad!

Aside: He's updating [his own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history) because no one else will :joy: yeah i looked up other Professors he may be stalking ... they're not updating their own Wikipedia pages, it's getting updated by other well known Wikipedia users with actual accounts. lol sad.

This dude has no friends, failed personal relationships (including his own marriage), total freakshow **incel**. complete and absolute, walking and talking, unmedicated and **untreated mental illness**.

[A System for Accessible Artificial Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90512-9_8) this is not in a top journal and it has barely any citations but ... but its supposed to be apparently the biggest breakthrough in AI so much so it elicited frivolous IP claims. Nobody cares about this, i don't care about this work.

4/14 - im actually really busy all day today so i will come back to this over the weekend .. this is important lawyer work .. he's legitimizing himself via wikipedia and twitter, by himself, not via other people. it's all himself, self-promotion to stay afloat in a competitive field, so pathetic. This **proves** that he's been spying/stalking people at wcmc and me since 2017 and he has an extreme inferiority complex and gets personally triggered by other peoples happiness and success -- that he just cant achieve for himself, ever.

4/20 - i discovered another website that big ugly jason has been depositing information into, a lot after more after 2017 than previous years. there's information depositing on Feb 23 and April 23 over the years. So this has been a seriously deep obsession for him, **like this is one of the worst stalker types ever possible.** there are other things i found that i wont say here, but he's CLEARLY very very mentally ill, it doesnt seem like hes been getting any help at all. what is this you cant even resign from a job anymore without some hillbilly taking it personally; he's very very verrryyyy deeply mentally ill and he has no friends thats what i keep discovering over and over again. the other thing i noticed is that his mental health has been way worse since i discovered my emails were going to him and this whole IP thing, his life just sucks. 

how many wanted stars like in GTA are paul and jason going to get for this whole thing i wonder, it must suck everyday for them not knowing whats going to happen next

# How Jason Moore attempts to legitimize himself in academia: the long con
*	Publish papers to the Journal he is EIC of (BioData Mining with an impact factor = 4.079 (as of 2021))
*	Frequently update his own Wikipedia page and then also the Wikipedia page of Marylyn Ritchie (did she ask him to do this, I don’t get it?)
*	Recruit former students as Post-docs/Faculty (because no one else will hire them) because he selects or attracts people with low self-esteem that cannot think except for what he tells them to, so they can’t really make it out on their own after being his student. They cannot survive without his connections and ideas (e.g. epistasis), which aren’t that great either.
*	Follow random people on Twitter to bring up his follower count
*	Tweet articles that he likely doesn’t completely read and use the hashtags #bioinformatics #artificialintelligence #machinelearning -- all areas he has no training in from Grad school (i.e. he never studied under a Professor who has training in this area. He has never published in top journals/conferences in AI/ML.)
*	Cite his own papers
*	Publish these “10 top lists” type of papers that only reference his work in the citations (so veiled self-promotion) and they don’t get much citations, if any. They’re just there, they just exist to bloat a CV. They otherwise could have been blog posts.
*	Have his former/current students, people in his cult, cite his papers, their own papers etc.
*	Publish work in AI that gets 0 citations, in other words, it’s not interesting, no one reads it, no one cites it. It’s just there, it just exists to bloat his CV. Or lick cookies, so he can say “hey I came up with it first” etc.
*	Pursue frivolous intellectual property lawsuits/whatever
*	Stalk/spy on former (a) employee(s)
*	Stalk/spy on potential employers of former employees
*	Stalk/spy on the private lives of potential employers of former employees
*	Defame/slander via racism and misogyny people to make himself seem more legit and knowing of things even though he's a half-wit
*	Name his software after the school: e.g. "PennAI" to use the name of the school to legitimize and bring attention to his otherwise average work with barely any citations
*	Build meeting rooms that no one really needs like the Idea Factory
*	Hire the “Paul Wang” type to run a Bioinformatics Core, someone completely underqualified who does not publish which is bizarre for Directors of Bioinformatics Cores – but Jason has no training in bioinformatics ... except what he picked up on Wikipedia ... how would he know the difference when someone is qualified or isn’t.
* Buy domain names for projects when it's really supposed to be hosted on *.penn.edu
* [claiming as an author to a article to extremetech.com that he has formal training in AI when he never did or that he knows what data science is](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319005-the-day-i-learned-what-data-science-is)
   * "My own academic training is grounded in a specific biological application domain but with __formal training in artificial intelligence (AI),__ complex adaptive systems, and statistics. I didn't know it at the time, but my cross-disciplinary training prepared me very well for a career in data science."

What is it called when you can't stop laughing but you also want to vomit at the same time from all the cringe and disgust lol, that's how I feel. [AHHH look it's Dunning-Freddy-Kruger :joy:](https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Jason.Moore/photo)

# Jason Moore's Education/Training Discrepancies and Claims
* [January 11, 2021 claiming as an author to a article to extremetech.com that he has formal training in AI when he never did or that he knows what data science is](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319005-the-day-i-learned-what-data-science-is)
   * "My own academic training is grounded in a specific biological application domain but with __formal training in artificial intelligence (AI),__ complex adaptive systems, and statistics. I didn't know it at the time, but my cross-disciplinary training prepared me very well for a career in data science."
   * the article reads as something written by an enthusiast and hobbyist, really, it truely does, because he does not have the training in the area, he did not do the work, but he's telling people how the field is suppose to work
   * very bizarre and weird, there are no citations to his claims in the article from sources in data science, it's just his personal experience and (lack of) understanding that he keeps mentioning
* according to [this (persoanl webpage):](https://jasonhmoore.org/education/) 
   * "I also took several courses in the Center for the Study of Complex Systems." so he never took classes in Computer Science or AI or Computational Biology, never recieved a degree in Complex Systems, Computer Science/AI
* [lying about his Masters degree, also this is quite hilarious](https://github.com/tangerinemarigold/Hey_Jason_Moore____ThisIsJustTheBeginningOfYourSelf-InflictedDownfall_DontBlameMeOrOthersEver/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-19%20at%207.48.00%20AM.png) so if he can lie about his degree, he can lie about anything really
* [this contains the ToC for the thesis that jason submitted](https://www.proquest.com/openview/2f865a3b4099031be7e6f2cc7b743a0e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)
   * there's nothing in the ToC that even hints at anything to do with artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science and bioinformatics (microarrays existed at that time)
   * looks very average from the ToC, incredibly average
   * looks like he did lab work during his PhD
   * [seems like hes been copying off his phd advisors interest in complex systems all along, chicken or the egg i dont know who decided to work on complex systems first, who influenced who, who is the bigger hobbyist/enthusiast: jason or his phd advisor](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/human-genetics/charles-sing-phd#websites)

# Topics and News that doesn't make it to Jason's Twitter at all, suspiciously ... perhaps because it hits too close to home (if you catch my drift) ... not perhaps, but that's exactly why
* Trumps indictment ... anything (bc he knows he's next :joy:)
* George Santos ... anything (bc jason knows exactly who George Santos is and what he's doing. In fact, jason's been taking notes on George Santos, is extremely impressed, and keeps saying to himself ["wow, I never thought of that one before."](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/guide-george-santos-lies.html))
* [Fake scientific papers are alarmingly common](https://www.science.org/content/article/fake-scientific-papers-are-alarmingly-common)
* `#metoo` anything ... oh wait there was a tweet but it was immediately deleted
* some life hack article on how to deal with and come to terms with one's own uglinesses and that it's rapidly only getting worse every single day :joy:
* some life hack article on what to do when your wife leaves you ... because youve been stalking a resigned employee for 6 years after they resigned, who knew you were a dumbass the entire time and now know youre a bigger dumbass
* some life hack article on what to do if youre consistently the dumbest person in the room every time youre in a different room ... and people keep leaving your shithole, hmmmmmm maybe you were the problem the entire time
* some life hack article on what to do when you commit perjury (because we all know you're going to do that)
* some life hack article on what to do when you keep soiling your underwear every single day because of forthcoming legal issues you will face for situations you created out of thin air because youre a dumbass
* some wikihow article on how to put a ruler inside your mouth (refering to jason's mouth), to measure how "big" Rand Paul is ... or some lookalike jason found with the same curly hair and suit and said to himself "close enough"
* some article on incel violence, e.g. ['Incel' Violence, Misogynistic Extremism on the Rise](https://www.newsweek.com/incel-violence-misogynistic-extremism-rise-secret-service-warns-1688353) bc it hits way to close to home, in fact its home plate

* [Dead cat strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_strategy)




# Etc
This is all going to look very bad in front of a judge

This is going to go on, legally for years, a lot happened

These people are dumb enough to commit perjury, I'm calling it now because the whole point is to save face. This can go on for over a decade, back and forth, back and forth. Ugh.
