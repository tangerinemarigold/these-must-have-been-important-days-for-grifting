[A System for Accessible Artificial Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90512-9_8) this is not in a top journal and it has barely any citations but ... but its supposed to be apparently the biggest breakthrough in AI so much so it elicited frivolous IP claims. Nobody cares about this, i don't care about this work.
